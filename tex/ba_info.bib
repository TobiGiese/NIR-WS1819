 abstract = {This paper shows that one can be competitive with the k-means objective while operating online. In this model, the algorithm receives vectors v{\_}1,...,v{\_}n one by one in an arbitrary order. For each vector the algorithm outputs a cluster identifier before receiving the next one. Our online algorithm generates {\~{}}O(k) clusters whose k-means cost is {\~{}}O(W*). Here, W* is the optimal k-means cost using k clusters and {\~{}}O suppresses poly-logarithmic factors. We also show that, experimentally, it is not much worse than k-means++ while operating in a strictly more constrained computational model.},

@article{Yang.2017,
 abstract = {Coresets are small sets of points that approximate the properties of a larger point-set. For example, given a compact set {\$}\mathcal{S} $\backslash$subseteq \mathbb{R}{\^{}}d{\$}, a coreset could be defined as a (weighted) subset of {\$}\mathcal{S}{\$} that approximates the sum of squared distances from {\$}\mathcal{S}{\$} to every linear subspace of {\$}\mathbb{R}{\^{}}d{\$}. As such, coresets can be used as a proxy to the full dataset and provide an important technique to speed up algorithms for solving problems including principal component analysis, latent semantic indexing, etc. In this paper, we provide a structural result that connects the construction of such coresets to approximating matrix products. This structural result implies a simple, randomized algorithm that constructs coresets whose sizes are independent of the number and dimensionality of the input points. The expected size of the resulting coresets yields an improvement over the state-of-the-art deterministic approach. Finally, we evaluate the proposed randomized algorithm on synthetic and real data, and demonstrate its effective performance relative to its deterministic counterpart.},

 abstract = {We show how to approximate a data matrix {\$}\mathbf{A}{\$} with a much smaller sketch {\$}\mathbf{\tilde A}{\$} that can be used to solve a general class of constrained k-rank approximation problems to within {\$}(1+$\backslash$epsilon){\$} error. Importantly, this class of problems includes $k$-means clustering and unconstrained low rank approximation (i.e. principal component analysis). By reducing data points to just {\$}O(k){\$} dimensions, our methods generically accelerate any exact, approximate, or heuristic algorithm for these ubiquitous problems.  For $k$-means dimensionality reduction, we provide {\$}(1+$\backslash$epsilon){\$} relative error results for many common sketching techniques, including random row projection, column selection, and approximate SVD. For approximate principal component analysis, we give a simple alternative to known algorithms that has applications in the streaming setting. Additionally, we extend recent work on column-based matrix reconstruction, giving column subsets that not only `cover' a good subspace for {\$}\bv{A}{\$}, but can be used directly to compute this subspace.  Finally, for $k$-means clustering, we show how to achieve a {\$}(9+$\backslash$epsilon){\$} approximation by Johnson-Lindenstrauss projecting data points to just {\$}O(\log k/$\backslash$epsilon{\^{}}2){\$} dimensions. This gives the first result that leverages the specific structure of $k$-means to achieve dimension independent of input size and sublinear in $k$.},

 abstract = {Given a set $F$ of $n$ positive functions over a ground set $X$, we consider the problem of computing {\$}x{\^{}}*{\$} that minimizes the expression {\$}\sum_{f\in F}f(x){\$}, over {\$}x$\backslash$in X{\$}. A typical application is \emph{shape fitting}, where we wish to approximate a set $P$ of $n$ elements (say, points) by a shape $x$ from a (possibly infinite) family $X$ of shapes. Here, each point {\$}p$\backslash$in P{\$} corresponds to a function $f$ such that {\$}f(x){\$} is the distance from $p$ to $x$, and we seek a shape $x$ that minimizes the sum of distances from each point in $P$. In the $k$-clustering variant, each {\$}x$\backslash$in X{\$} is a tuple of $k$ shapes, and {\$}f(x){\$} is the distance from $p$ to its closest shape in $x$.  Our main result is a unified framework for constructing {\em coresets} and {\em approximate clustering} for such general sets of functions. To achieve our results, we forge a link between the classic and well defined notion of {\$}$\backslash$varepsilon{\$}-approximations from the theory of PAC Learning and VC dimension, to the relatively new (and not so consistent) paradigm of coresets, which are some kind of {\dq}compressed representation{\dq} of the input set $F$. Using traditional techniques, a coreset usually implies an LTAS (linear time approximation scheme) for the corresponding optimization problem, which can be computed in parallel, via one pass over the data, and using only polylogarithmic space (i.e, in the streaming model).  We show how to generalize the results of our framework for squared distances (as in $k$-mean), distances to the $q$th power, and deterministic constructions.},

@article{Zhang.2017,
 abstract = {We present methods for k-means clustering on a stream with a focus on providing fast responses to clustering queries. When compared with the current state-of-the-art, our methods provide a substantial improvement in the time to answer a query for cluster centers, while retaining the desirable properties of provably small approximation error, and low space usage. Our algorithms are based on a novel idea of {\dq}coreset caching{\dq} that reuses coresets (summaries of data) computed for recent queries in answering the current clustering query. We present both provable theoretical results and detailed experiments demonstrating their correctness and efficiency.},
